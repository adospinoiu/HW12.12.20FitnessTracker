# HW12.12.20FitnessTracker

This application tracks a users workout and reports metrics on it.

The application uses MongoDB as the database and is hosted on Heroku.

The user starts by selecting the type of workout: cardio or resistance.

Upon selection (and depending on the selection) additional input fields appear for the user to enter informatin about the exercise performed.

The user then enters the relevant information about the exercise and completes the exercise. The data is then sent to the database.

The user may elect to add another exercise (to the current workout) or elect to complete the workout.

The application tabulates all the information and presents it in graphical form on the 'stats-page' accessed through the Dashboard-Link.
